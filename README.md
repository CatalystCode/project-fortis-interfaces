## Overview

This repository contains the user-interface tier of the Fortis architecture, below highlighted in red in the architecture diagram for the entire system.

This repository implements a ReactJS application that sits in front of the Fortis services layer.

## Development Setup

As per the diagram above, there are two pieces necessary to run this repository
locally: an instance of the Fortis services layer and the React application in
this repository. You can spin up the former by following the steps described in
the [project-fortis-services](https://github.com/CatalystCode/project-fortis-services)
repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CatalystCode/project-fortis-services
cd project-fortis-services
docker-compose up -d
```

After the services layer is created, you can run the React application:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CatalystCode/project-fortis-interfaces.git
cd project-fortis-interfaces
docker-compose up
```

After the server started, head over to the following URLs to play with the service:
- http://localhost:8888/#/site/INSERT_YOUR_SITE_NAME_HERE/admin
- http://localhost:8888/#/site/INSERT_YOUR_SITE_NAME_HERE

## Production setup

Build production asset bundle and run locally:

```sh
npm run build
npm install -g pushstate-server
pushstate-server build
```
